IMPORTANT:

ECE465 students should add the following line at the beginning of paging.h:

#define ECE465


NOTE: use QUANTUM=10ms for all test cases

-------

small_testcases.c
=================
Perform small virtual heap allocations, and allow to incrementally test: 
- vcreate 
- vmalloc
- vfree
- page fault handler: lazy allocation and segmentation fault
- allocations requiring multiple pages of PT
- concurrent processes

Outputs:
- ECE465 students: small_testcases_ece465.out
- ECE565 students: small_testcases_ece565.out

large_testcases.c
=================
Perform large virtual heap allocations 

Outputs:
The test case outcome is embedded in the run. 
If you need more information to debug your code, uncomment the "#define DEBUG" line. The outputs containing debugging information are the following:

- ECE465 students: large_testcases_ece465.out
- ECE565 students: large_testcases_ece565.out

Note that, in multi-process runs, the processes' interleaving might change from run to run (possibly affecting the debugging output). For grading, we will disable debugging.

swapping_testcases.c 
====================
Perform large virtual heap allocations causing swapping.
Note: have a look at the information in the comments at the beginning of the test case file.  
 
Output: 

- ECE465 students:
 * swapping_testcases_ece465.out - prints up to 50 evictions/swappings per test case 
 * swapping_testcases_full_ece465.out - prints all the evictions/swappings (this is a large file!)

- ECE565 students:
 * swapping_testcases_ece565.out - prints up to 50 evictions/swappings per test case 
 * swapping_testcases_full_ece565.out - prints all the evictions/swappings (this is a large file!)
